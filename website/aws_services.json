This model enables you to commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1- or 3-year term to get cost savings.\n\nSavings Plans can be used to optimize the cost of several computing services, most specifically AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EC2 instances. There are two types of Savings Plans available - Compute Savings Plans, which provide the most flexibility and can be applied to any instance family, size, region, operating system or tenancy, and EC2 Instance Savings Plans, which provide deep discounts for specific instance families in a region.\n\n## Pricing\nWith AWS Savings Plans, a user commits to a specific amount of compute usage, measured in dollars per hour, for a 1- or 3-year term. When this committed usage limit is exceeded, the standard pay-as-you-go rates apply.\n\nThe specific discount that a user receives depends on several factors, including the type of Savings Plan (Compute Savings Plan or EC2 Instance Savings Plan), the term length (1 or 3 years), the payment option (All upfront, Partial upfront, or No upfront), and whether the Savings Plan is convertible.\n\nFor a general idea, saving can range from around 10% (for lower commitment levels with No upfront payment) up to 72% (for higher commitment levels with All upfront payment).\n\n## Interesting Facts\n- Savings Plans can bring significant savings even to organizations with unpredictable workloads because they apply to compute usage across any AWS region, instance family, size, and operating system.\n- Savings Plans provide flexibility to use the discount in any way that a user sees fit, not tying the user to specific instance types.\n- AWS provides recommendations tailored to each user's usage pattern to help them identify the most cost-effective Savings Plan for their needs.\n- It's interesting to note that Savings Plans could actually encourage developers to optimize and manage their instances more effectively, in order to maximize the benefits of the plan.",

Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog. As a result, you can create a unified metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning. Athena processes queries in parallel, returning results in seconds. \n\n## Pricing\nWith Athena, you pay only for the queries you run. The cost is determined by the total amount of data scanned by each query. You can get significant cost savings and performance gains by compressing, partitioning, or converting your data to a columnar format, because each of these operations reduces the amount of data that Athena needs to scan to execute a query. Athena uses a managed Data Catalog to store metadata information for databases and tables, for which there is a separate fee.\n\n## Interesting Facts\n- Unlike traditional databases, with Athena, there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing data immediately. You don\u2019t even need to load your data into Athena, it works directly with data stored in S3.\n- Athena supports a wide variety of data formats including CSV, TSV, JSON and others.\n- Athena uses Presto, a distributed SQL engine to run queries. It also supports ANSI SQL.\n- Athena leverages Amazon S3 as its underlying data store, making your data highly available and durable.
